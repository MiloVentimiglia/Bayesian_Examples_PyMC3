# PyMC3 Examples and Probability Inequalities
* These are a collection of PyMC3 examples I wrote up
* The aim is to show how PyMC3 works on some real world problems such as marketing and regression 
* Another aim is to write up some notes of Probability Inequalities
* I borrowed some example but included acknowledgement 

* I'm going to add other examples to this in the near future
