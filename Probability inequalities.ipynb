    "We can estimate the error rate of a model by finding a confidence interval for $\\hat{L}_{n}(h)$ (that is the training error rate) using probability inequalities. We can consider this method a theoretical method that is similar in effect to cross-validation. This method is also useful in the context of [empirical risk minimization (ERM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_risk_minimization). I wrote my [Masters thesis](https://www.academia.edu/6660809/Concentration_Inequalities_and_some_applications_to_Statistical_Learning_Theory_Contents) on the applications of Probability inequalities to time series data mining and machine learning, this may be of interest.

    "##Â Classifier problem\n",
    "We will for simplicity consider a classifier problem. Let $\\mathcal{H}$ be a set of classifiers, for example, all linear classifiers. ERM means choosing the classifier $\\hat{h} \\in \\mathcal{H}$ to minimize the training error $\\hat{L}_{n}(h)$, also called the **empirical risk**. This we can be all fancy and mathematical and write $$ \\hat{h} = argmin_{h \\in \\mathcal{H}} \\hat{L_{n}}(h) = argmin_{h \\in \\mathcal{H}}  \\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\Sigma_{i} I(h(X_{i}) \\neq Y_{i})\\right)$$\n",
    "Typically , $\\hat{L}_{n}(h)$ underestimates the true error rate. This is why we use **Hoeffding's inequality** to assess the underestimation. Recall that if $X_{1}, \\ldots, X_{n} \\;\\tilde\\; Bernoulli(p)$, then for any $\\epsilon \\gt 0$, $$\\mathbb{P}\\left(|\\hat{p} - p | \\gt \\epsilon \\right) \\leq 2e^{-2n \\epsilon^{2}} $$ \n",
